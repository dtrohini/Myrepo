**Introduction**
    The aim of this project is to do automated testing for web application using Selenium WebDriver. 
    Selenium will simulate user interactions such as clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating web pages, and validating the correctness of displayed content.

**Testing**
    **Tools & Technologies:**
•	Selenium WebDriver: For interacting with web elements in browser
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Browser Driver: ChromeDriver
•	Eclipse IDE: The main development environment for writing and managing Selenium test scripts
•	Maven: A build tool used for managing project dependencies

   **Workflow:**
•	**Environment Setup**
    Install Eclipse, Java Development Kit (JDK) and Selenium WebDriver
    Configure WebDriver ChromeDriver

•	**Setup in Eclipse**:
    Add the given project through Open Project from File System
    Use Maven to manage Selenium dependencies

•	**Write Test Cases**:
    Create Java classes to write Selenium test cases
    Use WebDriver methods to interact with web elements (e.g., findElement, click, sendKeys, etc.)

•	**Run Tests**:
    First run the given application, backend server and the frontend Flutter Web application. Accessing the application via http://localhost:8081 in web browser
    To run Test : Run As > Java application
    Review the test execution results in the console view

**Videos**
    Video recordings of setup run and the execution of Selenium test case

**Issues**
